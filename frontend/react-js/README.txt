#ABOUT PROJECT
My plan was to create a scalable CityPanel which can be used easily by typing <CityPanel city = {city-name} />
In that way we can add multiple CityPanels and switch cities quick
There are also some stuff that can be improved in the future, for example adjusting the number of days for the forecast, something like <CityPanel days = {number-days}/>
